    <p class="center">EPISODE I<br />
      Making it Out Alive</p>

    <p>It is a period of all out warfare.</p>

    <p>Mario has spent the last 3 months frozen inside the star cruiser of the infamous Lord Vader, leader of the Galatic Empire. Everyone assumes Mario has been killed.</p>

    <p>Mario was the leader of the rebel forces and humanity's last chance for freedom and peace. Upon his supposed death most of the rebels who followed him have surrendered to the ruling Empire.</p>

    <p>Rebels who wouldnt give up have made one final all-out attack against Lord Vader. They were able to greatly damage Vader's ship, forcing him to flee in a speeder.</p>

    <p>In the midst of the attack, a hole has been blown in the side of the Star Cruiser. The cryogenic chamber holding Mario has been busted open as well, sending him flying through space.</p>

    <p>Mario now finds himself alone, in the middle of a deadly battleground. He spots an abandoned ship and although it may be useless, it is his only chance to reach safety, reunite with the other rebels, and figure out what has been going on the past few months.</p>
